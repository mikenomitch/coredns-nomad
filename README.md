# coredns-nomad

## Description

This is the initial skeleton of a CoreDNS Nomad plugin. This is based off of the [example plugin](https://coredns.io/explugins/example/).

This does not do anything yet, but it does provide a basic framework for getting started. I will likely not have time to complete this soon,
so I am sharing this to potentially save another person a bit of time getting started.

## To Do

The TODOs listed in comments in nomad.go and nomad_test.go were my next steps.

### License

Most of the plugins have an Apache license, see [this example](https://github.com/coredns/example/blob/master/LICENSE), so I would add that.
